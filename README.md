Our project “Fourier Illustrator” is a mathematics-based application that helps users understand how Fourier Series work through the use of adjustable hands-on simulations similar ones used in schools such as “PhET”. The main idea behind our application is to use epicycles as an intuitive way to represent the sine and cosine waves which make up any Fourier Series, allowing users to clearly see how the sum of simple waves of different frequencies and amplitudes can make up any complex periodic function.

In order to use our application, one must simply run the “Main.java” file. On the menu screen, the user is given the option to choose between “Drawing Mode” and “Epicycle Mode”. Once they have chosen an option, the user is presented with a large white box in the middle of their screen and controls which change depending on the mode. Additionally, the user can change modes at any time using the “Change Modes” button at the top of their screen.

    For the drawing mode, the user is able to drag their mouse across the white box to draw figures which are then converted into epicycles using a Fourier Transform by analyzing the figure drawn by the user as a periodic function made up of multiple points. The user can then manipulate the epicycles using the controls, such as hiding the epicycles, changing their drawing speed, stroke color, stroke width and stroke opacity, and can pause, play or reset the drawing at any time. Additionally, the user can edit the accuracy of the epicycles by changing the point density using a slider at the bottom of the screen. This slider changes the number of points being plotted per second when the user is drawing in the box, which changes the number of epicycles that are used, and in-turn changes the accuracy of the drawing. 

    For the epicycle mode, the user is able to get to the root of the Fourier Series process by adding and removing their own epicycles to the white box and adjusting their parameters to visualize how a sum of epicycles can represent any periodic function. Similar to the drawing mode, the user can manipulate the epicycles using controls and can even use a drop-down menu to select which specific epicycle they want to edit. Additionally, the user can create new tabs, allowing them to draw new images without needing to delete their old ones. This mode is fundamentally imperative to our project as it allows the user to understand how impressive the Fourier Transform is that it can take any drawing and turn it into a sum of epicycles, no matter the intricacy.
